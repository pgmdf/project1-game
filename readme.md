# Project 1

**Short description**

The first project in the Ironhack WebDevPT course should be a game. I decided to build one that adopts the general gameplay of the card game "Quartett". 

## General Tasks

1. Render a game in the browser.
2. Have logic for winning and/or losing
3. and show feedback to the player in either case.
4. Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
5. Use plain JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
6. (or HTML canvas for graphics).
7. Have a repo on GitHub.
8. Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
9. Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
10. Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles.
