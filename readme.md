# Project 1

**Short description**

The first project in the Ironhack WebDevPT course should be a game. I decided to build one that adopts the general gameplay of the card game "Quartett". 

## General Tasks

1. Render a game in the browser.
2. Have logic for winning and/or losing
3. and show feedback to the player in either case.
4. Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
5. Use plain JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
6. (or HTML canvas for graphics).
7. Have a repo on GitHub.
8. Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
9. Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
10. Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Useful learnings & tools
1. mobile first should not go without a plan for larger screens
2. keep your classes - referred to in html - in order and clean
3. mobile devices do have a f*ckin' large variety in screen-sizes
4. never underestimate research (data, pictures, …)
5. try to hit the ground running as fast as possible
6. ask family and friends to test - "learned" UX/UI could be a surprise 
7. You shouldn't been testing and developing with your browser scaled to 75%!!!

- Github Projects is a good alternative to any projectmanagement-tool (like trello) - but it doesn't make sense to play the role of the developer and the pm at the same time
- Adobe Capture (mobile app) is great for saving your inspirations
- Adobe XD offers good utility for UX/UI flow and basic CSS definitions
